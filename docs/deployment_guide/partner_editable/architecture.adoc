image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/mongodb-atlas-sagemaker-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* In the MongoDB SaaS account:
** A MongoDB cluster.
** A MongoDB Atlas Realm trigger to send database change events to Amazon EventBridge in the customer account.
* In the customer account:
** EventBridge to ingest MongoDB change events from the Realm trigger and send SageMaker result events back to the MongoDB database. EventBridge uses the following event buses and rules:
*** A Partner SaaS event bus to receive MongoDB change events from the Realm trigger.
*** A rule to route events to the pull events AWS Lambda function.
*** A custom event bus to receive SageMaker result events from the pull events Lambda function.
*** A rule to route results to the push results Lambda function.
** Two Lambda functions:
*** A pull events function to read events from the Partner SaaS event bus and get results from SageMaker.
*** A push results function to write results from SageMaker to the MongoDB database in the MongoDB SaaS account.
** An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for model-training artifacts.
** Amazon SageMaker to provide an endpoint to a pretrained ML model.
