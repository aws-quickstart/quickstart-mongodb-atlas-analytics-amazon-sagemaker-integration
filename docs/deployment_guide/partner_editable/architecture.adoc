As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A MongoDB Atlas Realm trigger to create a Partner SaaS event bus source in Amazon EventBridge. The trigger lets you send MongoDB change events to an event bus.
* An Amazon SageMaker endpoint from the provided model image URI and link to where the pre-trained model artifacts are stored.
* A pull Lambda function from the provided image URI to read the events from the event bus and get the results using the SageMaker endpoint.
* A push Lambda function from the provided image URI to write the results back to MongoDB.
* An EventBridge custom event bus and event rules to route events to the pull and push Lambda functions.
