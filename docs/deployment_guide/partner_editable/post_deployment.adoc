// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

Testing the solution involves inserting records into MongoDB collection manually or through any application and observe results in the target collection.

=== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

There are many considerations for production-grade deployments. While this Partner Solution demonstrates some of these, such as database-user security and peering, see https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/best-practices/[Atlas Production Best Practices^] for the latest information.

Choosing the correct Atlas cluster tier and configuration is an important step in setting up a successful production MongoDB deployment. You can always modify a cluster at a later time, but getting started with the right configuration is possible with a few calculations based on your data set size and network requirements. For more information, see https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/production-considerations/[MongoDB Atlas Production Considerations^].

=== Security

This Partner Solution provisions a cluster with security and TLS enabled by default. Optionally, network peering can be enabled on a new or existing AWS VPC. For more information, see https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/setup-cluster-security/[MongoDB Security Features and Setup^].

If you plan to use AWS Lambda, ensure that you follow the recommendations from https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/best-practices-connecting-to-aws-lambda/[Best Practices Connecting from AWS Lambda^].
